### Any issues you encountered
the major issue is that google cloud platform is very new to me, and it provides a lot of functions for users but also complicate and hard for me to figure out those functions. 

other issues are more because I use Windows PC instead of Mac, so sometimes it is hard for me to identify that whether I got a system error and system stop running or it still running in background. 


### A summary of the data collected: number of attacks, number of malware samples, etc.
Over 90% of the attacks are from the U.S., and I think that is because the zone i choose is west-coast-of us.
