CyberSecurityWeek9 HoneyPot Documentation

###Which Honeypot(s) you deployed
I deployed "Ubuntu - Dionaea with HTTP" as Honeypot


###Any issues you encountered
the major issue is that google cloud platform is very new to me, and it provides a lot of functions for users but also complicate and hard for me to figure out those functions. 

other issues are more because I use Windows PC instead of Mac, so sometimes it is hard for me to identify that whether I got a system error and system stop running or it still running in background.
